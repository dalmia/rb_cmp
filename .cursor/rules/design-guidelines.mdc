# Solve Ninja Changemaker Portfolio (CMP) Platform - Design Guidelines

## Project Overview
A platform for Solve Ninjas to submit their civic and climate actions and showcase them in their changemaker portfolio. Solve Ninjas are action-oriented youth engaged in hyper-local civic and climate action, developing 21st century skills while creating resilient communities.

## Design Philosophy

### Core Values
- **Youth Agency**: Empower young people as architects of change, not just participants
- **Hyper-Local Focus**: Solutions tailored to specific communities and local data
- **Action-Oriented**: Emphasis on doing, not just learning
- **Collaborative**: Community-driven problem solving
- **Skill Development**: Building 21st century capabilities through real-world application

### Visual Identity
- **Colorful & Playful**: Use vibrant colors that reflect energy and optimism
- **Ninja Theme**: Incorporate ninja character aesthetics with different personalities/types
- **Modern & Accessible**: Clean, contemporary design that works for all users
- **Process-Driven**: Visual representation of the Discover → Investigate → Solve → Share journey

## Color Palette
- **Primary Green**: #2ECC71 (representing environmental action)
- **Ocean Blue**: #3498DB (representing civic engagement) 
- **Sunset Orange**: #F39C12 (representing youth energy)
- **Deep Teal**: #34495E (representing stability and trust)
- **Bright Accent**: #E74C3C (for call-to-action elements)
- **Background**: Light grays and whites for readability

## Ninja Character Types (User Personas)
- **Techno Tiger**: Tech-savvy, data-driven problem solver
- **Reporting Rhino**: Research-focused, investigative journalism approach
- **Hands-on Hippo**: Community organizer, direct action oriented
- **[Additional types as needed]**: Each with distinct visual representation

## Core Features to Design For

- Categories aligned with the 4-step process: Discover, Investigate, Solve, Share
- Rich media support (photos, videos, documents)
- Tagging system for local issues and solution types

### Portfolio Dashboard
- Visual representation of user's journey and impact
- Progress tracking through the Discover → Investigate → Solve → Share cycle
- Skill badges and achievement system

### Forms & Interactions
- Progressive disclosure to avoid overwhelming users
- Smart defaults based on user's location and interests
- Real-time validation and helpful error messages
- Encouraging micro-interactions and feedback

### Interactive Elements
- **Cursor Behavior**: All clickable elements (buttons, links, interactive cards, modals triggers, etc.) MUST include the `cursor-pointer` class to ensure consistent user experience
- **Hover States**: Provide clear visual feedback on hover for all interactive elements

- **Recognition**: Celebration of achievements and impact stories

## Accessibility Requirements
