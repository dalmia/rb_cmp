## Theory of Change

Reap Benefit activates and empowers youth to become Solve Ninjas by championing consistent climate and civic actions in their hyper-local contexts, which is to say, right in their own backyards.

As these Solve Ninjas engage more deeply, they pick up essential 21st-century skills and create valuable public assets like local data and community solutions. This empowers them to tackle hyper-local civic and climate challenges head-on, shaping them into active citizens, entrepreneurs and innovators, and first responders to crises—a cycle that fosters resilient communities and improves local governance, one action at a time.

## Levers of Change

Our 'Secret Sauce' includes five powerful levers designed to energise and empower Solve Ninjas, pushing them towards consistent civic and climate action at the hyper-local level:

* **Network of Local Mentors:** Giving Solve Ninjas access to context-savvy mentors to guide them across all stages of hyper-local problem-solving. After all, even Batman needed an Alfred!
* **Peer Community:** Connecting Solve Ninjas to a community of like-minded youth. Together, they will learn from one another, fuelling a movement faster than you can say, "Ninjas, assemble!"
* **Knowledge, Toolkits & Solutions:** With access to a youth-driven repository of 550+ innovative ideas and solutions to local civic and climate issues, Solve Ninjas hold the key to bottom-up change within communities!
* **Access to Local Data:** Using data from our tech platform, Solve Ninjas can level up their problem-solving game, using it like a compass to guide them through a maze of local challenges!
* **Consistent Behaviour Nudges:** Through our tech and grassroots engagement, we nudge Ninjas to take consistent actions in their communities. Even the best need a gentle prod every now and then!

## Our Operational Model

Our goal to activate 10 million youth by 2030 is brought to life through a three-pronged model:

* **Top-Down Approach:** Governments and CSOs adopt our AI-powered open-source technology, Samaaja, to leverage our learnings and implement scalable, data-driven interventions. Cultivate partnerships with large-scale institutions to integrate our tools, knowledge, and technology, to scale civic and climate action efforts.
* **Bottom-Up Approach:** Solve Ninja Communities foster consistent, collective action by bringing together youth from both grassroots mobilization and top-down adoption. Grassroots mobilization through Reap Benefit's Tech Platform enables local youth to become Solve Ninjas, driving civic and climate action at the hyper-local level.
